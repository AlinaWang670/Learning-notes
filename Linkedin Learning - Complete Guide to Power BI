3. Enhancing the data model: The basics

3.1 Navigate the Power BI desktop
- top: ribben
- right: many pins
- left: report view, Data view, Model view

3.2 Understanding Dimensional modeling
- Data modeling methodology that centers around measuring business processes
- The BUSINESS PROCESS are known as FACTS
- and when we measure business processes, we need ways to describe those measurements
- for this we use DIMENSIONS as report labels and/or filters
- the combination of Facts and Dimensions is known as a Star Schema or Dimensional Model
- In the example:
	- The business process is Sales
	- the Dimensions are Products, Sales Territories, Order Date
- Benfits of a Dimensional Model:
	- Make your data structures easier to navigate, manage, and consumer over time
	- Easier to layer in more information while keeping model results predicable
	- Enable consistent analysis across an organization
	- Power BI is optimized to consume these models

3.3 Create relationships and manage settings
- Model View, Manage Relationships, New, select tables, select key columns, cardinality, cross filter direction, close
- Avoid many to many relationship, deduplicating the dimension table
	- Transform data, go back to power query, Home, Reduce Rows, Remove Rows, Remove Deplicates
	- come back to the relationship and change to many to one
- Stardardize the column name first, hold the key and move to the other to build a relationship

3.4 Modify column properties
- Table view, right data, select column,column tools, data category, 'country'/'city' --> categorize column
- column 'total sales', column tools, format 'Currency', 'usd', repete to other columns
- Formating
- set default, column tools, Summarization, 'Don't summarize'/'sum'

3.5 Create a column group
- select 'sales territory country', Data groups, select the ungrouped values, rename the groups and members, check 'include other group', rename the groups name

3.6 Create Hierarchy
- Model view, Product table, right click column 'Product category', create Hierarchy, Rename the name, Hierarchy, choose columns, hidden the subcategory

3.7 Optimize relationship
- Model view, some relations are built on number/text, 
- Home, transform data, Combine, merge queries, sale & sale territory, product id/territory key, replace repetting data, close & apply
- all relationships are based on numbers

3.8 Discuss data model cleanup
- Model view, select the columns and Hidden columns

4. Enhancing the Data Model - DAX Basics

4.1 Understand DAX
- What is DAX
	- Data Analysis Expressions
	- Modeled after Excal Formula language
	- Functional Language
	- Used to encapsulate business logic in your data model
	- Example:
		- Calculate a Full name from a First and Last Name
		- Calculate Gross Margin %
		- Calculate Year over Year & changes
- Syntax: Full Name = Customer[FirstName] & " " & Customer[LastName]
	- First part of the formula is the name of the column or measure that is being created
	- the name can contain spaces
	- Followed by an equal sign
	- This returns that value to the right of the equal sign
	- Table names are required whenever the column is form a different table than the current table. Table names must be enclosed in single quotation marks if they contain spaces, other special characters or any non-English alphanumeric characters

4.2 Create basic DAX expressions
- Calculated on a row-by-row basis
- Creates a new physical column
- Take up space in the data model
- Value is calculated at data load time 
- Typically reside in dimension table to be used as labels on reports and/or slicers
- Can often be pushed into the Power Query engine
Line Total Sale = Sales[UnitPrice] * Sales[OrderQuantity]
- About Measures
	- An aggreagte of a column
	- Do not take up space in the model
	- Value is calculated at run time
	- Typically reside in fact tables
	- Belong to the data model
- Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Line Total Sales])
- Filter Context
	- This context is applied by taking all filters that surround a DAX expression and then applying the filters to the expressions to affect its result
- Some areas where context can be applied or affected
	- Within a visual
	- Visual level
	- Page level
	- Report (all pages) level
	- Inside an expression
	- Visual interactions

4.3 Use logical expressions in DAX
- Primary Buyer = AND(Customer[Cars Owned] = 0, Customer[Home Owner] = "No")
- Secondary Buyer = OR(Customer[Cars Owned] = 0, Customer[Home Owner] = "No")
- New Column, Color category = IF('Product'[Color] IN {"Black", "Blue", "Red"}, "Darker", "Lighter")

4.4 Comprehensive create calculated columns and measures: Part one
- Line Product Cost = Sales[Order Quantity] * RELATED('Product'[Standard Cost]), formatting
- table, right click, new column, Line Margin = Sales[Line Total Sales] - Sales[Line Product Cost]
- Line Margin % = DIVIDE(Sales[Line Margin], Sales[Line Total Sales], 0)
- visual is taking the sum function, the results is incorrect

4.5 Comprehensive create calculated columns and measures: Part two
- Create Measure
- Total Margin = SUM(Sales[Line Margin])
- Total Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Margin], [Total Sales], 0), formatting
- I've got the correct value being calculated for total margin. And the reason this one is correct is it is first doing the aggregations to the appropriate level. So it is going through and figure out what my total sales is for the year and what my margin is for the year, and then it's going and doing the division. So it does the aggregations first to the appropriate level, then it goes through and does the division. 
- building simple measures, using those simple measures and other measures to create more complex measures, and then just keep layering them on top of each other. 
- The really nice thing about this is this really does promote maintainability in your measures as you're starting to add more and more into the mix. 

4.6 Comprehensive create calculated columns and measures: Part three
- moving away from reliance on calculated columns
- SUMX = SUMX(table, sum of the expression)
- create measure, Total Sales SUMX = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Unit Price] * Sales[Order Quantity])

4.7 Use the Filter function
- add measure, Count of sales orders line items = countrows (sales), formatting
- add measure, Count of sales orders = DISTINCTCOUNT (Sales[Sales order number]), formatting
- Count of Sales Orders Line Item GT 50 = COUNTROWS (FILTER (Sales, Sales[Line Total Sales] > 50 )), formatting

4.8 Use the all function
- add measure, Count of ALL Sales Orders Line Items = COUNTROWS(ALL(Sales)); Remove all the filters that are afecting the Sales table for this expression
- add measure, Pct Sales Orders Line Items ALL Time = DIVIDE([Count of Sales Orders Line Items], [Count of ALL Sales Orders Line Items], 0)

5. Enhancing the Data Model: DAX Time Intelligence

5.1 Build a date table
- Table tools, New table, create calender table:
Order Date = CALENDAR (Min(Sales[Order Date]), Max(Sales[Order Date])), change column name, data type: Date
start date, end date
- Order Date Year = Format('Order Date'[Order Date], "YYY")
- Order Date Month = Format('Order Date'[Order Date], "MMM")
- Order Date Month Number = MONTH('Order Date'[Order Date]), Summarization, Don't summarize

5.2 Disable the auto date/time setting
- it will overinflate the size of your model
- File, options and setting. current file, date load, Time intelligence, check Auto date/time

5.3 Design a date table
- Table view, Table tools, Mark as date table, select a column
- requirments: unique values, no null values, contiguous date values, if it's a date/Time data type, it has the same timestamp across each value

5.4 Build realtaionship betweem order date and sales
- connect order date table to sales table
- follow a star schema + have a date table designated to take advantage of the time intelligent functions

5.5 Basic time intelligence functions
- YTD Sales = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Order Date'[Order Date]), Order Date table, Sort by column, Order Date Month Number
- formatting
- New Measure, QTD Sales = TOTALQTD([Total Sales], 'Order Date'[Order Date]), formatting

5.6 Use the CALCULATE function
- SUMIF function; evaluates an expression in a context modified by filters.
- SAles table, new measure, PY Total Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], SAMEPERIOFLASTYEAR('Order Date'[Order Date]))

6. Enhancing the Data Model: Quick Measures

6.1 Use Quick Measure
- Sales table, right click, add quick measure, Calculations, Year-over-year change, Base value - Total Sales, Date - Order Date, Number of periods - 1;
- daxformatter.com, format the code
