LL - Advanced SQL, Logical Query Processing, Part 2

Lesson 1: Subqueries and set operators

1.1 Subqueries
- Table expression / Scalar expression / Row expression
- Non-correlated / Correlated
- Correlated: 
      Select Foo,
        (Select AVG(Foot)
          From Bart
          Where Bart.Foot = Foobar.Foo
        ) As Bar
      From FooBar;
  - be aware of the alias in the subqueries
- EXITS: happen in correlated tables
      Select *
      from Persons AS P
      Where Exists (
        Select NULL
        From Adoptions AS A
        Where A.Adopter_Email = P.Email
      );

1.2 Set Operators
- UNION ALL | DISTINCT
- EXCEPT ALL | DISTINCT
- INTERSECT ALL | DISTINCT
- set operators stand between two different queries
- Set Operators vs. Joins
  - Join combine two tables expressions horizontally. The result rows depend on the type of Join, but may contain attributes from one or both sources.
  - Set operators combine two table expressions vertically. The result consists of the matching attributes from both sets, and typically these are the same attributes.
- Intersect/ intersect distinct
- Except; except all
- not exists

Lesson 2: Advanced joins

2.1 Self and inequality joins
- Self joins: use table at from 
- Non-Equality Joins
      - Bule INNER JOIN Organge
            ON Blue.Value > Orange.Value
      - Every join begins with a Cartesian product (every element from table A is matched with every element from the table B)
